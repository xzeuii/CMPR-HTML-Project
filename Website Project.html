		<h1>Welcome to my CMPR100 Website Project!</h1>
		<p>Over my time in this course, I strengthened a lot of my exisiting knowledge around computers and their place in the world. My favorite topics being cloud computing and deeper OS knowledge.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Cloud Computing was one of my favorite topics because my previous knowledge of it was, "My PC can't run this game, so let me stream it using GeForce Now instead", but knowing <br>
				that it's used for Data Storage, Analysis, Web Apps, and so much more is extremely interesting to me.</li><br>
				
				<li>OS Knowledge was another topic I liked learning about, because my knowledge in it was also rooted in Video Games. You hear the terms "Ring 0" and "Kernel Level" thrown around<br>
				a lot when it comes to anti-cheats, like Riot's "Vanguard" or Activision's "Ricochet", and whether their intrusivity is worth it in the long run. Getting to know what those terms mean <br>
				in an educational setting rather than through heated debates made the topic so much easier to learn about and understand.</li>
			</ol> <br>
		<p> The video below showcases the danger that giving an application Ring 0 access, even if the app is trusted, can bring to the security of your computer. </p>
